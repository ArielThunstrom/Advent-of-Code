Advent of Code 2021
* Day01.java 
  * Part 01 Solution: First, I took the data set provided and converted it into an ArrayList. The first method in my code is creating an ArrayList of integers. After I had created the ArrayList I made a method called increase that compares the previous element to the current element to determine if the current element is greater. If the currect element is greater, then a variable called count is increased. The method will return count, the number of increases in the data set. 
  * Part 02 Solution: For the second part of this problem, I approched it similarly to my previous method for part one. I used another for loop that went over the list except this time I started at the second element in the thrid element of the list. Everytime the loop runs I am initializing two sum variables, the previous sum and the current sum, and then comparing them and increasing if the current sum is greater. 
* Day06Part1.java
  *  The first part of this problem that I did was creating an ArrayList with the data set that I was given. I first created an array with my data and then converted the array to an ArrayList using a method that I wrote. After all my data was in an ArrayList, I started to work on the promt given. To find the amount of fish after 80 days I used nested for loops. The first for loop is going to run for the amount of days that the method is sent. The second for loop is going to go through each element in ArrayList of data and increas/reset the lantern fish timer and add more fish.
* Day07Part1.java
  *   This problem was much more difficult to figure out what is was asking, so the first thing I did was write out on paper what the goal of the program was and what methods I needed to create in order to accomplish the goal. I started by first creating some simple methods to find the max and the min value in the data set. Next, I created a method that would create a new array to store the difference of each value between min and max. I created another method called difference to find the difference and they stored it into that new array. Once the new with the differences was creates, I then found the minimum of that array and returned that value to complete the problem.
* Day09.java
   *    For this problem, I worked a lot with 2D arrays to find the low points in the data set. For the corners of the 2D array, I only needed to check 2 values but for the many values I had to check the values on all 4 sides. Because of this, I created if statements that check if the value is a corner, edge, or middle value. This made sure that I would not get an index out of bound errors. For this problem I also created many small methods so that my code was easier to debug.
